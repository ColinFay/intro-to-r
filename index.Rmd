# An Introduction to R {-}
<p>This is an introduction to R (“GNU S”), a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is similar to the award-winning<a href="023-R-intro.html#FOOT1" id="DOCF1"><sup>1</sup></a> S system, which was developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers et al. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques (linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, ...).</p>
<p>This manual provides information on data types, programming elements, statistical modelling and graphics.</p>
<p>This manual is for R, version 3.4.2 (2017-09-28).</p>

# Preface {-}
<p>This introduction to R is derived from an original set of notes describing the S and S-PLUS environments written in 1990–2 by Bill Venables and David M. Smith when at the University of Adelaide. We have made a number of small changes to reflect differences between the R and S programs, and expanded some of the material.</p>
<p>We would like to extend warm thanks to Bill Venables (and David Smith) for granting permission to distribute this modified version of the notes in this way, and for being a supporter of R from way back.</p>

<h4 id="suggestions-to-the-reader" class="subheading">Suggestions to the reader</h4>
<p>Most R novices will start with the introductory session in Appendix A. This should give some familiarity with the style of R sessions and more importantly some instant feedback on what actually happens.</p>
<p>Many users will come to R mainly for its graphical facilities. See <a href="014-R-intro.html#Graphics">Graphics</a>, which can be read at almost any time and need not wait until all the preceding sections have been digested.</p>
